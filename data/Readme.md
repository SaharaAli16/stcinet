There are two notebooks for generating synthetic data:
1. With spatial interference
2. Without spatial interference

For real world data, we downloaded the following variables from [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means) on monthly frequency:

1. Latent Heat FLux (60N)
2. Sensible Heat Flux (60N)
3. Longwave downward radiation (60N)

The monthly sea ice concentrations data was accessed from National Snow and Ice Data Center [NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/smmr_ssmi/data) for the Arctic region.
